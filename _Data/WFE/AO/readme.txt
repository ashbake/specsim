Last week, Dimitri asked if the two spreadsheets from the previous email could be combined and simplified.  I put together 3 tabs with tables that cover 3 MODHIS observing sequences:

1. LGS AO with on-axis TTF star
2. LGS MCAO with off-axis TTF stars
3. NGS mode using the NFIRAOS Pyramid WFS on-axis

Hopefully, this is enough information to include in an initial MODHIS ETC.  I tried to simplify and combine the contents of the parent documents while still giving enough insight into the source of the errors. 

We can identify a few AO simulations that Lianqi can run in the next couple of months:
1. LTAO focused only on maximizing the on-axis performance with on-axis PWFS TTF star
2. a few NGS performance estimates using NGS of different magnitudes with different overall AO performance

Dimitri and Ashley, if you have any questions, we should set up a meeting to discuss the TMT performance with Lianqi.

Lianqi, if you notice any errors in these tables, please let me know.
